<BODY>

A terminal controller for ANSI/VT100 compatible terminals or terminal 
emulators. This package has been tested with GNU/Linux terminal emulators:
Linux virtual terminals, Gnome Terminal, KDE Konsole and xterm. Raw I/O
mode is required under GNU/Linux e.g. 'stty raw -echo' before running your
application ... use 'stty sane' to restore the terminal ater the Java 
application exits. Similar arrangements may work on other OSs but have
not been tested.
