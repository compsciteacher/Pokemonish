<BODY>

Generic event handling utilities.
<P>
Events not only carry data, but can have "roles". Roles are
String metadata that describes what the event represents.
It is up to the user of this event API to decide what this
is used for.
<P>
For example, the event object might be a String, and the role
"property/title" signifies that the event source has changed a 
(JavaBeans) property called "title".
<P>
Role names that start with "property/" are reserved for property changes
(in the JavaBeans sense). Custom roles that are specific to your application
should be prefixed with "app/[your-applications-name]".
