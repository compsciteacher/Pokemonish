TESTS


@Test: test_ansi_termctl_cursor_motion

Tests the motion of the cursor under the ANSI/VT100 TerminalController 
implementation.

The output for this test should look like this, starting from the home 
position:

00000001 ABCDEFG
34444451 00000001
37888951 34444451
37123951 37888951
37154951 37123951
37100051 37154951
37666661 37100051
32222222 37666661
         32222222


@Test: test_ansi_termctl_character_styles

Output is self-explanatory. Styles of each row should match the 
description in each row, where those character attributes are 
supported.


@Test: test_ansi_termctl_character_colors

Outputs 8 rows each of 16 '*' characters. The backgound colour is
changed from left to right, cycling though black, red, green, yellow,
blue, magenta, cyan and white twice per row. The foreground colour is 
changed for each row - it is cycled once through the same list of colours.
The last 8 '*'s on each row are printed with the bold attribute
switched on. This pattern covers every combination of foreground
and background color and bold ("bright") attribute.
